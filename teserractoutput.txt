Mild Splendour of the various-vested Nightl
Mother of wildly-working visions! haill

I watch thy gliding, while with watery light
Thy weak eye glimmers through a fleccy vel;

And when thou lovest thy pale orb to shroud
Behind the gather'd blackness lost on high

And when thou dartest from the wind-rent cloud
